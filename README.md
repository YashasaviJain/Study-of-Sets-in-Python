# Study of Set in Python

## Student Information
- **Name:** Yashasavi Jain  
- **PRN:** 25070123127  

---

## Aim
- To study **Sets in Python**
- To understand properties of sets such as **uniqueness** and **unordered nature**
- To perform **set operations**
- To understand the concept of **Frozen Sets**

---

## Theory
A **Set** in Python is a collection of elements that is **unordered**, **unindexed**, and **does not allow duplicate values**.

### Properties of Sets
- Sets are created using curly braces `{ }`
- Duplicate elements are automatically removed
- Elements are not stored in a fixed order
- `True` and `1` are treated as the same value
- New elements can be added using `add()`
- Elements can be removed using `remove()` or `discard()`
- Membership can be checked using the `in` keyword

## Set Operations
Python provides various operations to work with sets:

- **Union (`|`)**  
  Combines all elements of two sets

- **Intersection (`&`)**  
  Returns common elements between sets

- **Difference (`-`)**  
  Returns elements present in one set but not in another

- **Symmetric Difference (`^`)**  
  Returns elements present in only one of the sets

---

## Frozen Set
A **Frozen Set** is an immutable form of a set.

- Elements cannot be added or removed
- Created using `frozenset()`
- Useful when data should remain constant

---

## Applications of Sets
- Storing unique participant names
- Finding common subjects among students
- Identifying students in multiple clubs
- Finding absent students
- Managing valid and discontinued course codes

---

## Conclusion
In this experiment, we studied **Sets and Frozen Sets in Python**.  
We learned that sets store only **unique elements** and support powerful operations like union, intersection, and difference.  
Using real-life examples such as students, clubs, and courses helped in understanding their practical use.  
Thus, sets are an important and efficient data structure in Python.
